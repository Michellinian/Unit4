# Week 34

For this week we had to work on a lot of stuff. First was the javascript practices. For me it was very hard, and I think I got at least 2 correctly functioning. For the vowel counter, I am still trying to figure out how to print different numbers for each vowels in the webpage. Also for the last practice on the doc, I did without coding in javascript, so I am guessing that I did it in the wrong way. I think I need to create a code in javascript which takes the userinput and saves it into a variable, and then print that variable on the webpage. I still need to work on that. Second of all for the codin games, this was also very hard, so I had to reference the answers that were on the browser. For the video assignment, this video was about the evolution of computer network. The early network created was the lan. This was a small network only between the computer that are connected with the same cables. Although as the numbers of computer grows there were collisions, therefore to develop its efficiency and fault-tolerancy, the system of message switching and package switching have been developed. This is under the IP or the internet protocol, and this allows the network to work. Finally for the IA, I still haven't come up with a good idea, so if possible I would like to have time to think more, and schedule a meeting around Wednesday or Thursday, to check my IA plans.
